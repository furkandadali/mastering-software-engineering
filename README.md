# 👨‍💻 Mastering Software Engineering

Hey there! 👋  
This is my personal playground and public repository where I collect practical examples, mini-projects, and real-world patterns about software engineering.

If you're learning programming, preparing for interviews, or just curious about clean and scalable code, feel free to look around — I try to keep everything as beginner-friendly and real-life-based as possible.

## 📂 What's Inside?

This repo is organized by topic — each folder includes small examples, concepts, and hands-on code.

| #  | Topic                          | Description |

| 1  | [OOP](./1.OOP)                 | Basics of Object-Oriented Programming |
| 2  | [CleanCode](./2.CleanCode)     | Code formatting, naming, and best practices |
| 3  | [SolidPrinciples](./3.SolidPrinciples) | SOLID explained with code samples |
| 4  | [DesignPatterns](./4.DesignPatterns) | GoF patterns (Builder, Factory, etc.) in action |
| 5  | [SystemDesign](./5.SystemDesign)     | UML, architecture, and design thinking |
| 6  | [Testing](./6.Testing)         | Unit tests, mocking, and TDD ideas |
| 7  | [DevOps](./7.DevOps)           | Git, CI/CD, Docker basics |

> Each folder is like a mini-module with short explanations and working code.

## 💡 Example – OOP

Inside [`/1.OOP`](./1.OOP), you'll find things like:

- `Encapsulation`, `Inheritance`, `Polymorphism`, `Abstraction` examples
- Code in different styles (c#)
- Tiny lessons with comments.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Real-life code samples you can run or adapt
- No bloated theory – just straight-to-the-point examples
- Easy to read, easy to fork
- Slowly building up into a bigger reference
